#MAchine laerning codes from very basics#
=========================================

ML and DSA are the two main Core topics needed as tools/concept in this technical world.

We need to integrate AI/ML either in Cloud Computing/Network/Cyber Security.

Thus, ML is needed must.

Now , lets dicuss about the concept of ML

CPU consists of Tarnsistors which only acts as >>on or off.
Thsi shows they don't have brain,
means they can't think or solve which is not predefined.

INDIRECTLY WE CAN SAY THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY IT'S INTELLIGENT


JUst by #programs we can make CPU smarter which can predict and tell the predicted answer.
Then we can say that yes, now it became INtelligent


For example- A smalll child needs to recognize their parents by taking data (picture) of 
parents, it can assume that this is a mode/ paytern of father for that baby.

More and more data is collected, more intelligent it will become.

IN MACHINE LEARNING , FOR THE SAME THING WE CALL AS #MODEL#.

more and more Model>> More iNtelligent(accuracy)

Model is not properly trained means leass data to be trined.
needed more data to be trained.

HERE, from day1-7 Linear regresssion model is there with proper explanation satrted with comment
HAsh which is written in python

later will bw uploaded soon.
